Great! Here’s the plan to create an EPUB reader using Node.js with a web-based GUI served by Express:

High-Level Architecture
Backend (Node.js + Express):
Serves static frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS).
Provides API endpoints to:
Upload EPUB files.
List available EPUBs.
Parse and serve EPUB content (chapters, metadata, images).
Frontend (Web GUI):
Modern, responsive UI for reading EPUBs.
Allows users to upload, select, and read EPUB books.
Displays chapters, navigation, and book metadata.
EPUB Parsing:
Use a Node.js library like epubjs or epub to extract content from EPUB files.
Next Steps
Scaffold the project structure.
Set up Express server.
Add file upload and EPUB parsing.
Build a simple frontend to display and navigate books.
Let’s start by scaffolding the backend and frontend directories, and initializing the Node.js project.

Here’s how I’ll proceed to turn your project into a web-based EPUB reader:

Plan
Backend (Express):
Add endpoints to:
Upload EPUB files.
List available EPUBs.
Serve EPUB content (chapters, metadata, images).
Serve a static frontend (HTML/CSS/JS).
Frontend:
Create a public/ directory for static files.
Implement a simple UI for:
Uploading EPUBs.
Listing and selecting EPUBs.
Reading EPUB content (chapter navigation, metadata).
EPUB Parsing:
Use a Node.js EPUB parser (such as the epub npm package).
Next Steps
Create a public/ directory for frontend assets.
Set up Express to serve static files from public/.
Scaffold API endpoints for upload, list, and read EPUBs.
Add dependencies (epub, multer for uploads) to 
package.json
.
I’ll start by creating the public/ directory and a basic index.html as the frontend entry point.

Created - public/style.css

Edited - src/main/express.mjs

The initial EPUB reader web app is now scaffolded and running:

What’s Done
Created a public/ directory with a modern, responsive HTML/CSS/JS interface.
Set up Express to serve static files and provide API endpoints for:
Uploading EPUB files.
Listing available EPUBs.
Retrieving book metadata and chapters.
Serving chapter content.
Integrated the epub, multer, and uuid npm packages for EPUB parsing and file uploads.
The backend and frontend are now connected and ready for you to upload and read EPUB files in your browser.
Next Steps
Open the EPUB Reader in your browser to test uploading and reading EPUBs.
If you want to add features like bookmarks, search, or user accounts, let me know!
You can now use your local EPUB reader at: http://localhost:3004
